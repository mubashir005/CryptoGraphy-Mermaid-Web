It can be probabilistic, meaning that encrypting the same message *m* with the same key *k* might produce different ciphertexts on different runs. This process is denoted as *c ← Enck(m)*. If *Enc* is deterministic, it is denoted as *c := Enck(m)*. The set *C* represents all possible ciphertexts generated by *Enck(m)*, across all choices of *k*, *m*, and any randomness used by *Enc*.\r\n3. **Decryption Algorithm (Dec):** A deterministic algorithm recovering *m* from *c* using *k*.\r\n\r\nKey aspects of encryption schemes:\r\n- **Perfect Correctness:** Decryption always recovers the original message, implying that the decryption process is deterministic.\r\n- The distribution of keys *K* is determined by the encryption scheme, while the distribution of messages *M* reflects the context and adversary’s uncertainty about which messages are likely to be sent.\r\n- Ciphertexts *C* are determined by the joint distribution of *K* and *M*, reflecting the encryption process.\r\n\r\n## Perfect Secrecy\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites:\r\n- The adversary knows the probability distribution of messages (*M*), meaning they understand the likelihood of different messages being sent.\r\n- The adversary is aware of the encryption scheme being used.\r\n- The key shared by the communicating parties is the only unknown to the adversary.\r\n- In this attack, one of the honest parties encrypts a chosen message, transmits the resulting ciphertext, and the adversary eavesdrops on the communication, gaining access to the ciphertext without any other context or information.\r\n\r\nPerfect secrecy ensures that observing a ciphertext *c* does not provide any information about the plaintext message *m*. This means the adversary’s knowledge of *m*, after observing *c*, is identical to their prior knowledge.\r\n\r\n### Formal Definition\r\nAn encryption scheme *(Gen, Enc, Dec)* with message space *M* is perfectly secret if for every probability distribution for *M*, every message *m ∈ M*, and every ciphertext *c ∈ C* for which *Pr[C = c] > 0*, it holds that:\r\n\r\n> *Pr[M = m | C = c] = Pr[M = m].*\r\n\r\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"61039f1a-ed45-54df-a864-f23e63c805e8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
