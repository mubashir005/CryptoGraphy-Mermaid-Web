This ensures that the PRG’s output appears uniformly random to any efficient observer.\r\n\r\nA distribution *Dist* on *n*-bit strings is considered pseudorandom if the process of sampling a string from *Dist* is indistinguishable from sampling a uniform *n*-bit string. Specifically, it should be infeasible for any polynomial-time algorithm to distinguish between a string sampled from *Dist* and a uniformly random string. Pseudorandomness is a property of distributions, not individual strings, and is defined as a computational relaxation of true randomness.\r\n\r\nIf *G* is an efficiently computable function that maps *n*-bit strings to outputs longer than *n*, and *Distₙ* is the distribution obtained by choosing a uniform seed *s* of length *n* and outputting *G(s)*, then *G* is a pseudorandom generator if and only if *Distₙ* is pseudorandom.\r\n\r\n## Definition\r\n\r\nLet *G* be a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm such that for any *n* and any input *s ∈ {0,1}ⁿ*, the result *G(s)* is a string of length *ℓ(n)*.\r\n\r\n*G* is a pseudorandom generator if the following conditions hold:\r\n\r\n1. **Expansion:** For every *n*, it holds that *ℓ(n) > n*.\r\n2. **Pseudorandomness:** For any probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm *D*, there is a negligible function *negl(n)* such that:\r\n   \r\n   > *Pr[D(G(s)) = 1] − Pr[D(r) = 1] ≤ negl(n),*\r\n   \r\n   where the first probability is taken over the uniform choice of *s ∈ {0,1}ⁿ* and the randomness of *D*, and the second probability is taken over the uniform choice of *r ∈ {0,1}^ℓ(n)* and the randomness of *D*.\r\n\r\n*ℓ(n)* is the expansion factor of *G*.\r\n\r\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"0a13db27-ef57-5282-b6c8-843461ce0433"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
