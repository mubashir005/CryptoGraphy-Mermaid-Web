The adversary chooses two messages *m₀* and *m₁* from the message space *M*.\r\n2. A key *k* is generated using the key generation algorithm *Gen*, and a random bit *b ∈ {0,1}* is selected.\r\n3. The message *m_b* is encrypted to produce a challenge ciphertext *c*, which is given to the adversary.\r\n4. The adversary guesses *b*, trying to determine which message was encrypted.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is perfectly indistinguishable if no adversary, regardless of computational power, can succeed with a probability greater than *1/2*, which represents a random guess.\r\n\r\n### Formal Definition\r\nAn encryption scheme *(Gen, Enc, Dec)* with message space *M* is perfectly indistinguishable if, for every adversary *A*:\r\n\r\n> *Pr[PrivKeav_A = 1] = 1/2*\r\n\r\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"06bcc5dd-ddc3-5e72-bbbc-e608e9cd61f4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
